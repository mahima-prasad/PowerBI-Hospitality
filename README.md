## 📌 Project Summary

### Situation

The AtliQ Grand's hospitality business was generating large volumes of booking, revenue, and operational data across multiple properties. However, performance tracking was fragmented, making it difficult to monitor key KPIs such as Occupancy %, ADR, RevPAR, and Realization %.

The dataset included:
- 120,000+ booking records  
- 4 city properties  
- 3 months of data  
- Multiple room categories and booking platforms  

This created challenges in identifying revenue trends, seasonal demand, and property-level performance.

### Task

Develop a structured and interactive analytics dashboard to:

- Track overall revenue performance  
- Monitor operational KPIs (Occupancy %, ADR, RevPAR, Realization %)  
- Compare property and city-level performance  
- Identify seasonal demand patterns  
- Enable data-driven pricing and revenue strategy decisions  

### Action

- Extracted and validated structured booking and revenue data using **SQL**
- Cleaned and transformed **100K+ records** using **Power Query**
- Built a **Star Schema data model** with fact and dimension tables
- Created **25+ DAX measures**, including:
  - Total Revenue
  - Occupancy %
  - ADR (Average Daily Rate)
  - RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
  - Realization %
  - Revenue Growth %
- Designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with:
  - Property-level filters
  - Week and month slicers
  - Room category segmentation
  - Drill-through and trend analysis visuals
- Structured KPI cards for executive-level reporting

### Result

- Identified properties operating at **75%+ average occupancy**
- Discovered **18–22% revenue growth during peak seasons**
- Highlighted underperforming properties with lower RevPAR
- Reduced manual reporting effort by approximately **60%**
- Delivered an executive-ready dashboard enabling faster strategic decisions
